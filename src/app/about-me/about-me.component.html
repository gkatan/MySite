  While working as a BI (Business Intelligence) Developer in the greater Tel Aviv area for the last two and a half years,
  I've discovered a passion for web development. I'm currently seeking my next adventure as a Front-End or Web Developer.

  I also love travelling and acrylic painting. Galleries will be added soon!

  This is my first website built in Angular 7 using Bootstrap 4 for styling. Please excuse any bugs - this site is still under construction as I continue learning Angular. All code is found on my <a href="https://github.com/gkatan/MySite"> Github</a>.
