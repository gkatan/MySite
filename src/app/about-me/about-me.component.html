  Raised in Portland, Oregon, I got my B.Sc. in Computer Science from Brandeis University in 2016 
  and immediately afterwards fulfilled my dream of aliyah to Israel!

<br>
  While working as a BI Developer in the greater Tel Aviv area for the last two and a half years,
  I've discovered a passion for web and front-end development.
<br>
<br>
  I also love travelling and acrylic painting. Check out my albums!
